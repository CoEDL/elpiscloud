### **Did you find a bug?**

  [open a new one](https://github.com/CoEDL/elpiscloud/issues/new).
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
  information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
  demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue,
  visit our [reporting guidelines](http://docs.elpis.cloud/en/latest/contributing#reporting-an-issue).

### **Did you write a patch that fixes an issue?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
  [Include the relevant issue number](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Elpis Cloud](http://docs.elpis.cloud/en/latest/contributing)
  guide to know more about our coding conventions and approval process.
